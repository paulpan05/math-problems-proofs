# Math Problems and Proofs Collection

This repository is a collection of all the Math problems and proofs I have worked on since June
2020.

It was created for the purpose of filling in any gaps I had in the first 2 years of undergrad and
preparing for my upper division Math minor classes.

## Sections
 - Discrete Mathematics (For CSE 20 and 20, MATH 109)
 - Theory of Computation (CSE 105)
 - Algorithm Design (CSE 101)
