\begin{theorem}
    $\forall$ even integers $m$ and odd integers $n$, $m + n$ is odd.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $m$ is any even integer and $n$ is any odd integer. By definition of even,
    $m = 2r$ for some integer $r$, and by definition of odd, $n = 2s + 1$ for some
    integer $s$. By substitution and algebra,
    \begin{align*}
        m + n = 2r + 2s + 1 = 2(r + s) + 1
    \end{align*}
    Since $r$ and $s$ are both integers, so is their sum $r + s$. Hence $m + n$ has the
    form twice some integer plus one, and so $m + n$ is odd by definition of odd.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Second theorem.
\end{theorem}
